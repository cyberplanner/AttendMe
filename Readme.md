# Attend me

"Attend me" features a follower HUD and automatic teleportation of your followers
(including effects such as Recall or Intervention, unlike the base game).

Requires a recent [development build of OpenMW](https://openmw.org/downloads/).

## To install

1. Copy all files to /Data Files directory
2. Find the config file located at \Documents\My Games\OpenMW\openmw.cfg, and those two lines:
    ```
    data="C:/PATH/TO/MOD_DIRECTORY/Attend Me"
    content=AttendMe.omwscripts
    ```
p.s of course you'll have to replace the path to data with the path to the mod directory on your PC
## Changelog

[1.6]:

* Adds a level up indicator in HUD
* Adds a progress indicator
* When the player is ready to level up the progress indicator changes to a message that reads "Advance to lvl: {nextLevel}"
